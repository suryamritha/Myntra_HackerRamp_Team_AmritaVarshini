FIND YOUR COLOR 

The purpose of the "Your_color" folder project involves creating a web application where users can upload images of clothing items. The application analyzes these images to extract dominant colors and suggest complementary colors using color theory algorithms. Additionally, it provides recommendations for clothing items that match the analyzed colors, enhancing the user's shopping experience by helping them discover suitable styles and color palettes.

OUTFIT VISUALIZER

As a Gen Z shopper, one of the major challenges I face during online shopping is visualizing outfits. I often struggle to determine if a top matches a particular style and color of jeans. To address this issue, we have developed a solution called the Outfit Visualizer.

The Outfit Visualizer allows you to add items from a shopping website to a virtual template. You can then arrange and reorder these items to see how well they go together. You can directly upload images of the items you like and style them accordingly. Additionally, you can save your outfits and share them with friends to get their opinions.

This tool can significantly reduce the number of items customers return due to dissatisfaction since they already have a preview of how the outfit will look. Furthermore, items from the template can be added directly to the cart if they match your style preferences.
